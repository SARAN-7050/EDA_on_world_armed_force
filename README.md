#EDA ON WORLD ARMED FORCES

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on World Armed Forces
Overview
This project conducts an EDA on data related to world armed forces. The analysis aims to gain insights into the distribution, composition, and capabilities of armed forces across different countries. The dataset used for this analysis is [provide dataset source and description].

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Ensure data consistency and quality.
Data Exploration:

Examine summary statistics of armed forces data.
Visualize key metrics such as troop strength, defense budget, and military equipment holdings.
Country-wise Analysis:

Analyze armed forces statistics on a country-by-country basis.
Identify countries with the largest and smallest armed forces.
Budget Allocation:

Explore how defense budgets vary among different countries.
Visualize defense budget allocations for the top countries.
Armed Forces Composition:

Investigate the composition of armed forces (e.g., army, navy, air force) within each country.
Identify trends in the size and capabilities of different branches.
Global Trends:

Identify global trends in armed forces over time (if applicable).
Analyze the evolution of armed forces capabilities.
Tools Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Ensure data consistency and quality.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for handling missing values
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('armed_forces_data.csv')
df.dropna(inplace=True)
Data Exploration:

Examine summary statistics of armed forces data.
Visualize key metrics such as troop strength, defense budget, and military equipment holdings.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for summary statistics
df.describe()

# Sample code for plotting defense budget distribution
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(df['defense_budget'], bins=20, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Defense Budget')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Defense Budget')
plt.show()
Country-wise Analysis:

Analyze armed forces statistics on a country-by-country basis.
Identify countries with the largest and smallest armed forces.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for identifying countries with the largest armed forces
largest_army = df[df['army_size'] == df['army_size'].max()]
Budget Allocation:

Explore how defense budgets vary among different countries.
Visualize defense budget allocations for the top countries.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for plotting top countries by defense budget
top_countries = df.nlargest(10, 'defense_budget')
plt.bar(top_countries['country'], top_countries['defense_budget'], color='green')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.ylabel('Defense Budget')
plt.title('Top 10 Countries by Defense Budget')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
Armed Forces Composition:

Investigate the composition of armed forces (e.g., army, navy, air force) within each country.
Identify trends in the size and capabilities of different branches.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for armed forces composition analysis
branch_columns = ['army_size', 'navy_size', 'air_force_size']
branch_data = df[branch_columns]
branch_data.describe()
Global Trends:

Identify global trends in armed forces over time (if applicable).
Analyze the evolution of armed forces capabilities.
python
Copy code
# Sample code for time-based analysis (if applicable)
df['year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['year'], format='%Y')
trend_data = df.groupby('year').mean()
#Tools Used
